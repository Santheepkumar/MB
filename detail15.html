							<h2>Srinivasa Ramanujan</h2>
						</header>
						<p>Srinivasa Ramanujan was born in southern India in 1887. After demonstrating an intuitive grasp of mathematics at a young age, he began to develop his own theories and in 1911 published his first paper in India. Two years later Ramanujan began a correspondence with British mathematician G. H. Hardy that resulted in a five-year-long mentorship for Ramanujan at Cambridge, where he published numerous papers on his work and received a B.S. for research. His early work focused on infinite series and integrals, which extended into the remainder of his career. After contracting tuberculosis, Ramanujan returned to India, where he died in 1920 at 32 years of age.</p>
